            <p>Based on a photo from my classmate, I will be putting the visual thinking principles into practice based on the article and my reflection from the previous journal entry. The photo I am analyzing is from Brooke. It displays a shark plushie on a pillow on a bed. The shark has its usual fins, a rounded head, and stitching for its eyes, gills, and mouth. The mouth is open and has a jagged outline to imply its sharp white teeth. It has a white belly with a grey acid-wash body. It’s rolled over on its side.</p>

            <p>It also seems to have extra markings on it - I’m guessing a pen drawing. There’s an anchor on its fin, and what seems like more gills or letters on its belly. Behind the shark is a piece of paper with a message on it. Only a corner of it is shown so I can only make out pieces of the message: row 1 shows “…I eat dumb”, row 2 shows “…ppies for” row 3 shows “…fast.”.</p>
                
            <p>The most interesting aspects of this image are probably its expressions, emotions and figures. The shark has an expression already, but expression from its owner(s) is implied through the drawings on its body in black and blue sketchy ink. Additionally, the paper behind it seems to have been written from the perspective of the shark, by the owner of the shark or written by a friend for the owner of the shark. One can conclude that the shark belongs to the person whose bed it lays on, and that is holds a level of importance to the owner and possibly its friends/others. The shark, its markings and the paper behind it convey expressions of playfulness, comedy and childlike spirit.</p>
                
            <p>The most obvious aspects of this image are the playfulness of the shark, its markings and the paper behind it. It is clear that the shark belongs to someone, is - to some extent - worn and owned with the tag cut off and its markings. It’s obvious that it lays on someone’s bed, and that the message on the paper most likely relates to the shark. What is mysterious is how worn the shark is - or how long it has belonged to its owner and how long ago the markings were made. Was it from someone’s childhood? Or did they do this more recently, possibly with friends? What is also unclear is how many people contributed to the markings and the message, and who exactly the message was made by and made for. I’m also curious about what is next to the shark - is that someone’s arm/shoulder from a cardigan or fuzzy jacket, or just a fuzzy pillow? Why did the person take this photo - is it from an inside joke, a special memory, or gift?</p>

            <h1>Visual Thinking</h1>
            <img src="images/visualthinking.jpeg" alt="journalimg2" width="600" height="300">
            <h3>Read the article: <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a></h3>       
            <p>I found the article "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" by Michael Gonchar on the New York Times to be both interesting and insightful. The use of photographs to teach close reading and visual thinking skills is a unique and fun approach to learning. The ten photographs presented in the article challenged me to analyze images more closely and think critically about what I see. The questions provided for each photograph sparked meaningful discussions and helped me understand the elements of each image as well as make connections to the world around me. Overall, this article has encouraged me to delve deeper into the meaning of images and develop my skills in close reading and visual thinking, making it a valuable resource for my design education.</p>

            <p>It was interesting to have the takeaways from the first article in my mind as I scrolled through awwwards.com. I found myself more perceptive to details and consciously looking for visual clues to deeper messages. This included choices of color, style, space and composition, movement/direction, and of course the focal points and objects pictured.</p>

            <h3>Read the article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a></h3>        
            <p>"Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi is an article that explores the best practices for designing modals, overlays, and dialog windows, which are commonly used in user interface design. The article outlines the key principles for creating effective modals, including accessibility, usability, and user experience (UX).</p>

            <p>The author stresses the importance of accessibility, which includes making sure that the modal or overlay can be easily closed by users, and that the design is compatible with assistive technologies such as screen readers. Usability is also crucial, with the modal or overlay being easy to understand, use, and navigate, and with clear and concise instructions provided.</p>
                
            
            <p>In terms of UX, the modal or overlay should be designed to fit seamlessly into the overall experience of the website or application, and should not be disruptive or confusing for users. The modal or overlay should also be designed to provide a clear purpose and value to users, and should be designed in such a way that users are motivated to complete the task or engage with the content.</p>

            <p>"Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari is an article that explores the importance of form design in user experience (UX) and how to create effective forms that are user-friendly and efficient. The article discusses the key principles of form design, including consistency, usability, accessibility, and feedback.</p>

            <p>According to the author, consistency is crucial in form design. The placement and labeling of form fields should be consistent throughout the website or application, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for. Usability is also essential, with forms that are easy to use, understand, and complete. This includes making sure that the form fields are clearly labeled, the instructions are concise and easy to follow, and the form is easy to navigate.</p>
                
            <p>Accessibility is another important factor in form design, as it helps to ensure that everyone can use the form, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure that the form is accessible to users with disabilities and that the design is responsive and adaptable to different devices and screen sizes. Feedback is also critical in form design, as it provides users with confirmation that their actions have been successful and helps to keep them engaged and motivated.</p>
                
            <p>In conclusion, form design is a crucial aspect of UX, and by following the best practices outlined in this article, designers can create forms that are user-friendly, accessible, and efficient. By making forms easy to use and understand, designers can help to improve the overall experience for users and achieve the goals of their website or application.</p>
