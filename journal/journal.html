            <img src="images/game.png" alt="gameimg" width="600" height="300">
            <h3>Read the article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a></h3>       
            <p>This article highlights the essential principles that game designers should consider to create an engaging and enjoyable user experience. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the user's needs and preferences and providing them with intuitive controls, clear instructions, and informative feedback. The article also covers the role of game mechanics, level design, and game pacing in enhancing the user experience.</p>

            <p>One of my key takeaways from the article is the significance of prototyping and playtesting in the game development process. The author suggests that designers should build a prototype early on to identify potential design flaws and test the game mechanics and features with a diverse group of users. This feedback can help designers refine their game and ensure that it meets the users' expectations and preferences.</p>

            <p>Another important point highlight in the article is the role of sound and visual design in creating an immersive experience. The author emphasizes that designers should pay attention to the aesthetics of the game, including the use of color, typography, and animation, to create an engaging and visually appealing environment. Similarly, sound design, including sound effects and music, can help enhance the game's mood and atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Ultimately the article provides valuable insights into the best practices of game design UX. I found this article useful in understanding the importance of user-centered design and the role of feedback in the design process. I also appreciated the emphasis on the role of aesthetics and sound design in creating an immersive experience. I'd like to apply these principles to the Studio 3 project and build a prototype early on to test and refine my design.</p>

            <h1>Visual Thinking Analysis</h1>
            <figure>

                <figcaption><i>fig. 1  </i> Brooke's Shark Photo</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Read the article: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a></h3>
            <p>Based on a photo from my classmate, I will be putting the visual thinking principles into practice based on the article and my reflection from the previous journal entry. The photo I am analyzing is from Brooke. It displays a shark plushie on a pillow on a bed. The shark has its usual fins, a rounded head, and stitching for its eyes, gills, and mouth. The mouth is open and has a jagged outline to imply its sharp white teeth. It has a white belly with a grey acid-wash body. It’s rolled over on its side.</p>

            <p>It also seems to have extra markings on it - I’m guessing a pen drawing. There’s an anchor on its fin, and what seems like more gills or letters on its belly. Behind the shark is a piece of paper with a message on it. Only a corner of it is shown so I can only make out pieces of the message: row 1 shows “…I eat dumb”, row 2 shows “…ppies for” row 3 shows “…fast.”.</p>
                
            <p>The most interesting aspects of this image are probably its expressions, emotions and figures. The shark has an expression already, but expression from its owner(s) is implied through the drawings on its body in black and blue sketchy ink. Additionally, the paper behind it seems to have been written from the perspective of the shark, by the owner of the shark or written by a friend for the owner of the shark. One can conclude that the shark belongs to the person whose bed it lays on, and that is holds a level of importance to the owner and possibly its friends/others. The shark, its markings and the paper behind it convey expressions of playfulness, comedy and childlike spirit.</p>
                
            <p>The most obvious aspects of this image are the playfulness of the shark, its markings and the paper behind it. It is clear that the shark belongs to someone, is - to some extent - worn and owned with the tag cut off and its markings. It’s obvious that it lays on someone’s bed, and that the message on the paper most likely relates to the shark. What is mysterious is how worn the shark is - or how long it has belonged to its owner and how long ago the markings were made. Was it from someone’s childhood? Or did they do this more recently, possibly with friends? What is also unclear is how many people contributed to the markings and the message, and who exactly the message was made by and made for. I’m also curious about what is next to the shark - is that someone’s arm/shoulder from a cardigan or fuzzy jacket, or just a fuzzy pillow? Why did the person take this photo - is it from an inside joke, a special memory, or gift?</p>

            <h3>Read the article: <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a></h3>       
            <p>I found the article "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" by Michael Gonchar on the New York Times to be both interesting and insightful. The use of photographs to teach close reading and visual thinking skills is a unique and fun approach to learning. The ten photographs presented in the article challenged me to analyze images more closely and think critically about what I see. The questions provided for each photograph sparked meaningful discussions and helped me understand the elements of each image as well as make connections to the world around me. Overall, this article has encouraged me to delve deeper into the meaning of images and develop my skills in close reading and visual thinking, making it a valuable resource for my design education.</p>

            <p>It was interesting to have the takeaways from the first article in my mind as I scrolled through awwwards.com. I found myself more perceptive to details and consciously looking for visual clues to deeper messages. This included choices of color, style, space and composition, movement/direction, and of course the focal points and objects pictured.</p>
