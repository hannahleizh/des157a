                    <p>I made this raspberry tiramisu at home based on an instagram reel! It tasted so delicious - I crave  it all the time. I made it with the help of Vivian, who is a mom to me, and is super good at all things cooking and baking. I don't usually bake but this is definitely one of the best desserts I've had. Raspberry and matcha are such a good combo!</p>

                    <p>I was recently in Monterey for my 2 year anniversary and we went to this quaint breakfast restaurant and bakery. It was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! I ordered the salmon eggs benedict as pictured and it was insanely good. The first time I've had salmon with eggs benedict too.</p>

                    <p>On a trip to Honolulu this summer, I was swimming at the beach and walked around it to find a food truck with tons of fruity and full meal options! This meal probably tasted a million times better becasue of how hungry and dehydrated I was, but it was reallyy good. The pineapple acaii bowl was genius and the best acaii bowl I've ever had.</p>

                    <p>This is from a cute little dimsum place in Chinatown, San Francisco that had a dimsum bar where you can pick what you want and put it in a box to go. They let us eat at the one table they had inside and we ordered soo many dumplings and buns. Definitely one of my favorite restaurant experiences - and of course the food was amazing.</p>

                    <p>On a trip to San Diego last summer, I was downtown when a restaurant and bar called the Underbelly caught our eye. It had a really cool design and lights that make it look like the underbelly of a whale! The inside is really cool too, and we were pleasantly surprised when the food turned out to be fairly cheap and delicious!</p>
