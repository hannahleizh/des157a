                    <img src="images/raspimg.JPG" width="250" height="300" alt="rasp">
                    <p>I made this raspberry tiramisu at home based on an instagram reel! It tasted so delicious - I crave  it all the time. I made it with the help of Vivian, who is a mom to me, and is super good at all things cooking and baking. I don't usually bake but this is definitely one of the best desserts I've had. Raspberry and matcha are such a good combo!</p>

                    <p>I was recently in Monterey for my 2 year anniversary and we went to this quaint breakfast restaurant and bakery. It was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! I ordered the salmon eggs benedict as pictured and it was insanely good. The first time I've had salmon with eggs benedict too.</p>

                    <p>On a trip to Honolulu this summer, I was swimming at the beach and walked around it to find a food truck with tons of fruity and full meal options! This meal probably tasted a million times better becasue of how hungry and dehydrated I was, but it was reallyy good. The pineapple acaii bowl was genius and the best acaii bowl I've ever had.</p>

                    <img src="images/dimsumimg.jpeg" width="250" height="300" alt="dim">
                    <p>This is from a cute little dimsum place in Chinatown, San Francisco that had a dimsum bar where you can pick what you want and put it in a box to go. They let us eat at the one table they had inside and we ordered soo many dumplings and buns. Definitely one of my favorite restaurant experiences - and of course the food was amazing.</p>

                    <img src="images/ramenimg.JPG" width="250" height="300" alt="ram">
                    <p>On a trip to San Diego last summer, I was exploring downtown when a restaurant/bar called the Underbelly caught my eye. It had a really cool design and lights that make it look like the underbelly of a whale! The inside is really cool too, and we were pleasantly surprised when the food turned out to be some of the best ramen and chicken wings we'd ever had. The prices were also really good which was not expected!</p>
