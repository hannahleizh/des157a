            <h1>Project Summary</h1>
            <p>I will be expanding on and polishing up my Studio 2, Every Picture Project.</p>

            <h1>Project Goals</h1>
            <p>For this project, my first goal is to fix any issues - for example the multiple 'Eat Me!' buttons will stay on the screen if you mouse over multiple plates. Overall, I'd like to make the interactions more user friendly and smooth than they are now. I also want to change it by adding sounds, animations, and possibly a slideshow within the overlays.</p>

            <h1>Design Strategies</h1>
            <p>I want to play around a little more with color and font choices, but am not sure how much I will change there. For the rest of the look and feel, I want to smoothen my current interactions, add animations and possibly more interactions (such as the slideshow). I may change the form but I'll have to play around with compositions in Figma for the comp.</p>

            <h1>Interaction Strategies</h1>
            <p>For interactions, I want to make the current ones (hover, showing/hidden, etc.) more smooth and change the timers for the Eat Me buttons. I may add more timers. For new animations, I'm considering rotating the lazy susan and having the plates bob up and down or something else.</p>

            <h1>Experience Goals</h1>
            <p>In terms of experiences for the user, I plan to make interactions more smooth and easy to follow. I may add additional cues for users to understand what to do to prompt interactions. I also want to fix any glitches and have the interactions of hover, zoom and button fade-in work cohesively together. </p>
